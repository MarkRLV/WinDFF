Windows - Duplicate File Finder

A set of programs to search an entire computer and find files that are duplicates, with an easy-to-use GUI for viewing and deleting duplicates as desired.

Files are first compared by size.  If two or more are of the same size, each file is hashed with SHA256. If hashes are the same, they are the same file.
